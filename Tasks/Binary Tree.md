A Binary Tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent

> ## Types of Binary Trees
>
> - Balanced Binary Tree
> - Perfect Binary Tree
> - Full Binary Tree
> - Complete Binary Tree
> - Degenerate Binary Tree

> ### Balanced Binary Tree
>
> A Balanced binary tree is something were the node height of left minus node of right side height is not more than one.

> ### Perfect Binary Tree
>
> - A perfect binary tree must have two children for each node and have same depth or same level

---

> ### Full binary tree
>
> - This type of binary tree is a special type where every parent node has either children or no children.

---

> ### Complete binary tree
>
> - A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled from the left.

---

> ### Degenerate Binary Tree
>
> - A Degenerate Binary Tree is a binary tree in which all the parent node will have only one child node.
