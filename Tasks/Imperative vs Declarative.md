# Imperative Programming

- It the structure of code execution path, on how to execute things in order.
- Imperative programming uses statements.
- More like declaring a variable and changing the value of the variable.

```js
const printName = () => console.log("javascript");

console.log(printName()); //prints the value inside the function
```

# Declarative Programming

- It's like saying, what to do on execution.
- Declarative programming uses expressions.
- Working with the input and telling what to do.

```js
const changeCaseAndPrint = (input) => input.toUpperCase();

console.log(changeCaseAndPrint("javascript")); // this is dependent on the input and works as per the input given
```
